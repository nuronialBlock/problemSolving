using **cut**

By using cut, one can read all necessary text from a file in a line by line basis.

suppose, if we cat kanaMama.txt we get:

Halum 

Bhalum

Talum

But what if we are only interested in  2nd and 5th charecter ?

well, then-


```
cut -c 2,6 kanaMama.txt // assuming kanaMama.txt is in home folder  

```
